## Description

This repository contains notes and practice exercises of the Python 3 from scratch course. 

## How to use it? 

The main objective of this repo is to document some highlights of the classes I've taken for future reference. As well, hopelly it will be helpful to other developers starting their pythonist learning.
On the other hand it contains practice exercises, in many of them I setted out to go a step beyond what was requested in the assignment. For example modularizing from the very beginning, making some validations of data and handling errors , all of these are good practices that I apply in my daily work.

## Finally

As I progress with the course I will continue updating this repo. I 'm enjoying to learn Python and I am delighted because so far I see that it provides a lot of flexibility and it is widely used in very diferents tasks. Moreover, has an incredible amount of libraries and packages.
